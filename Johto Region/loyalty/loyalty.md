__**Johto Region Loyalty Rules**__

Before your character finishes their in-game day, they may roll to increase the loyalty of **ONE** of their Pokemon that was part of their party that day.
Bonuses may be awarded to the roll as follows:
Fought & finished a battle still conscious: +1 for each victory
Fought & fainted: -1 for each time fainted
Bonding with during this day (Role Play only, not the PHB Bonding mechanic): +4
Successful Trainer Training for the Pokémon's type: +2
Successful Pokémon Training: +1

The DCs to increase levels  are as follows:
DC to go from -3 to -2: 16
DC to go from -2 to -1: 10
DC to go from -1 to 0: 8
DC to go from 0 to +1: 10
DC to go from +1 to +2: 16
DC to go from +2 to +3: 20

If the Pokemon rolls a natural 20, they may roll again.  Otherwise, Pokemon can only increase by one level at a time, regardless of the total of the roll and bonuses.

If your Pokemon rolls below a 5 (including bonuses), they lose a level.

Once a Pokemon reaches Loyalty Level 3, their loyalty cannot be decreased.

If you **befriended** your Pokemon (caught at a higher DC without battling it), your **first** check is rolled with advantage.
