You can add your own lists to your server by creating a `svar` called `practiceTools`, `practiceWeapons`, or `practiceLanguages`.  Follow the same format as [this gvar](http://https://avrae.io/dashboard/gvars?lookup=0f04ee93-790d-401f-b91d-a42a7f2c7760) for tools or weapons and [this gvar](http://https://avrae.io/dashboard/gvars?lookup=1f0e238c-508a-435a-9e8a-c42e7e5de46f) for languages.  **Note:** setting a server list will replace the default list, so you need to copy the gvar contents if you want it to be included.
