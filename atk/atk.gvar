On a result of 1, the Pokémon is incapacitated and restrained until the beginning of their next turn and must forfeit their remaining action and bonus action to their trainer. If a creature is paralyzed and confused/asleep, the paralysis roll comes first. If it fails, it does not roll to wake or be confused. (Electric types are immune to this status condition)",
