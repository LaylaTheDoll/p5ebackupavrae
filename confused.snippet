During this time, it loses its ability to take reactions and moves at half speed. After selecting a Move to activate and spend PP on, it must roll a d20. On a result of 9 or lower, the creature hurts itself for an amount of damage equal to its proficiency bonus and may not make an attack, but the trainer of a confused PokÃ©mon still may take an action. On a roll of 20, the creature is no longer confused."
