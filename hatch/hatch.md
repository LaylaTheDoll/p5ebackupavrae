Need some help with hatching an egg?
**Running the command** 
`!hatch <Color>` will roll for the egg you specify (i.e. `!hatch Yellow` to roll for your Yellow Egg.  You can add `magma` for Magma Armor, `flame` for Flamge Body, `super` for a Super Incubator, or `inc` for an Incubator. 
Add `adv` to roll your hatching and incubator rolls twice, taking the higher result.  If you're a Breeder (set your subclass using `!level`), this will be done automatically.


**Making the counter** 
When you create the counter, name it "<Color> Egg" or some other descriptor followed by "Egg." `!cc create "Red Egg" -min 0 -max 300 -reset none` or `!cc create "Super Mega Legendary Egg" -min 0 -max 100000 -reset none`. Naming it something else will make the alias mess up."
