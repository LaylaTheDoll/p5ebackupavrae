-title "Need some help with hatching an egg?"
-desc "__**Running the command** __
`!hatch <Color>` will roll for the egg you specify (i.e. `!hatch Yellow` to roll for your Yellow Egg.  You can add `super` for a Super Incubator, `plus` for a Plus Incubator, or `inc` for a Basic Incubator. 
Add `adv` to roll your hatching and incubator rolls twice, taking the higher result.  If you're a Breeder (set your subclass using `!level`), this will be done automatically.

__**Making the counter** __
When you create the counter, name it \"<Color> Egg\" or some other descriptor followed by \"Egg.\" `!cc create \"Red Egg\" -min 0 -max 300 -reset none` or `!cc create \"Super Mega Legendary Egg\" -min 0 -max 100000 -reset none`. Naming it something else will make the alias mess up."
